\subsection{Rating by age}
Using two facts from two dimensions, we wish to measure the average rating by
age groups.\\
We create a table with the collumns age, moviieId and averageRating. We use age
and movieId as Primary Key, and add no additional indexes.\\
\begin{spverbatim}
### Rating by age ###
# One might want to know the average rating by a specific age group

CREATE TABLE averageRatingByAge(age INT, movieId INT, averageRating DOUBLE,
PRIMARY KEY (age, movieId));
INSERT INTO averageRatingByAge (age, movieId, averageRating) SELECT user.age,
rating.movieId, AVG(rating.rating) FROM rating JOIN user ON rating.userId =
user.id GROUP BY user.age, rating.movieId;
\end{spverbatim}
