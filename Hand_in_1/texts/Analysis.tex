\section{Analysis}
We have considered the following scenerios, where one might doubt that our implementations is in normal form: \\
\subsection{Role}
\begin{itemize}
  \qaitem {Isnt there a FD between a Person\_id and a Role\_id to Movie\_id in the contract table?}
          {We assume that a person can play more than one role per movie.}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Character}
\begin{itemize}
  \qaitem {Isnt there a FD between a character and a movie}
          {We assume that a character can apaier in more than once in a movie.}
  \qaitem {Isnt there a FD between a person and a character}
          {More than one person can play one character in movie.}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Rating}
\begin{itemize}
  \qaitem {Isnt there a FD between Moive and source to rating}
          {Yes. We assume that one source can only rate a movie once , else the rating is just editted}
\end{itemize}
